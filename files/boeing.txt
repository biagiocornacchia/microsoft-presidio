The Australian Defence Force has operated Boeing CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters for most of the period since 1974.
Thirty two of the type have entered Australian service, comprising twelve CH-47C variants, eight CH-47Ds and twelve CH-47Fs.
A further two CH-47Fs are scheduled to be delivered in 2022.
The helicopters have been operated by both the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Australian Army.
