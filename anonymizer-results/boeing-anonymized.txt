The Australian Defence Force has operated Boeing CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters for most of the period since <DATE_TIME>. Thirty two of the type have entered <NRP> service, comprising twelve CH-47C variants, eight CH-47Ds and twelve CH-47Fs. A further two CH-47Fs are scheduled to be delivered in <DATE_TIME>. The helicopters have been operated by both the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Australian Army.

An initial order of eight <NRP> for the RAAF was placed in <DATE_TIME>, but soon cancelled in favour of more urgent priorities. The <NRP> military still required helicopters of this type, and <DATE_TIME> Chinooks were ordered in <DATE_TIME>. The CH-47s entered service with the RAAF in <DATE_TIME>. The eleven surviving Chinooks were retired in <DATE_TIME> as a cost-saving measure, but it was found that the Australian Defence Force's other helicopters could not replace their capabilities. As a result, four of the CH-47Cs were upgraded to CH-47D standard, and returned to service in <DATE_TIME> with the Australian Army. The Army acquired two more CH-47Ds in <DATE_TIME> and another pair in <DATE_TIME>. The CH-47Ds were replaced with seven new CH-47F aircraft during <DATE_TIME>, and another three were delivered in <DATE_TIME>. A further four CH-47Fs were ordered in <DATE_TIME>, with two being delivered that year and two others being scheduled to arrive in <DATE_TIME>.

The Chinooks have mainly been used to support the Australian Army, though they have performed a wide range of other tasks. Three Chinooks took part in the Iraq War during <DATE_TIME>, when they transported supplies and <NRP> special forces. A detachment of two <LOCATION> was also deployed to <LOCATION> during <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME> for <DATE_TIME> between 2006 and <DATE_TIME> and 2008 to 2013, seeing extensive combat. Two of the CH-47s deployed to <LOCATION> were destroyed in crashes. The helicopters have also frequently been assigned to assist recovery efforts following natural disasters and undertook a range of civilian construction tasks while being operated by the RAAF.

During <DATE_TIME> the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) considered new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete cLRXMPMkSRldgLeXjswtZ97Kfx3wnUyO6zKS1oOq6Uk=. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland <LOCATION> DHC-4 Caribous. The RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the intended role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.

This disagreement ended in <DATE_TIME>. As part of the expansion of the military in response to <LOCATION>'s policy of "confrontation" with its neighbours, the RAAF was directed by the Australian Government to conduct an urgent evaluation of short takeoff and landing aircraft and heavy-lift helicopters that could be purchased to improve the Army's tactical mobility. An Air Staff Requirement was established in <DATE_TIME> that year for a project to acquire eight heavy-lift helicopters and introduce them into service by <DATE_TIME>. A team of seven RAAF officers headed by Group Captain 6KlTQhg78ZPzmEfnRK2wgUvnU/KuN8DewRndMRyLSmU=, the director of operational requirements, was immediately dispatched to <LOCATION> and assessed the Sikorsky S-61, Boeing Vertol 107-II and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The team judged the Chinook to be clearly the most suitable of these types, and recommended that several be acquired; this was in line with the Army's preference. The Government subsequently accepted a recommendation made by the RAAF to acquire a package of twelve Caribou fixed-wing aircraft and eight Chinooks, and placed an order for these aircraft within <DATE_TIME> of the evaluation. The Chinook order was cancelled by the Government when it was learned that it would take <DATE_TIME> for the helicopters to be delivered, and the RAAF's orders of Caribous and Bell UH-1 Iroquois tactical transport helicopters were expanded instead.

The <NRP> military continued to consider options to acquire heavy-lift helicopters throughout <DATE_TIME>, and a formal program to achieve this goal was initiated by the RAAF in <DATE_TIME>. The Federal Government's Cabinet approved the acquisition of twelve such helicopters in <DATE_TIME> that year. At this time the helicopters were intended to be deployed to <LOCATION> as part of the <NRP> contribution to the Vietnam War. A team of nine Air Force and Army officers travelled to <LOCATION> in <DATE_TIME> to evaluate the Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion and Chinook. The team, which was led by Group Captain Pdrmapdm9LNyiDmAvsOLF9tWG0jxJaWZp9hsTS4g/44=, recommended that CH-53s be ordered as the type had superior flying characteristics. Senior YGm/XqrlczbzdMDYY7jLvfOzn0gmn6CWJzWowfhHXZ8= officers and the Army were not pleased with this outcome, and the Air Board rejected Raw's report. Read, who was now an air vice-marshal and deputy chief of the air staff, was directed to review the choice of helicopters, and again recommended that Chinooks be acquired. He justified this choice on the grounds that the Chinook could carry more cargo than the CH-53 and was better suited for operations in the mountains of the <NRP>-administered Territory of Papua and <LOCATION>. The Government believed that both types met the RAAF's requirements, but a project to acquire Chinooks would be lower risk than purchasing CH-53s. As a result, an order for <DATE_TIME> was announced on <DATE_TIME>. It was planned to rotate the helicopters in and out of service, six being available at any time. The order was suspended later in <DATE_TIME> when a series of engine problems affected the United States Army's CH-47Cs, but was reinstated in <DATE_TIME> after these issues were resolved. The total cost of the purchase was $<US_DRIVER_LICENSE> million. The order made <LOCATION> the CH-47's first export customer.

The contract for the Chinooks included an offset agreement with Boeing through which the firm gave <NRP> companies opportunities to manufacture components of both the RAAF's helicopters and those destined for other customers. This was the first of several such agreements that were included in <NRP> military aircraft procurement contracts during <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME>, the goal being to assist the local defence industry to access international markets. This agreement had some benefits, as several of the participating <NRP> companies upgraded their factories to manufacture complex elements of the CH-47. The offset contracts for the Chinook concluded in <DATE_TIME>, but the improved equipment and manufacturing processes were employed in the project to build McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft in <LOCATION> <DATE_TIME>. In line with the RAAF's procurement and support philosophy and the aim of ensuring that the force was self-sufficient, a very large quantity of spare parts for the CH-47Cs was also ordered; in <DATE_TIME> it was reported that this was the second-largest stockpile of Chinook spare parts after that held by Boeing, and was worth more than $<US_DRIVER_LICENSE> million.

It was decided to station the <LOCATION> at RAAF Base Amberley, <LOCATION>, as it was located at the midpoint between the Army's main field formations that were based on the outskirts of <LOCATION> in <LOCATION> and the north <LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>. Construction began on support facilities for the helicopters at Amberley shortly after the order for them was confirmed in <DATE_TIME>.
