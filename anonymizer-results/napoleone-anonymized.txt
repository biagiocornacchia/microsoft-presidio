Napoleon dominated <NRP> and global affairs for <DATE_TIME> while leading <LOCATION> against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental <LOCATION> before its final collapse in <DATE_TIME>.

Born p/84HMOSUv9WN/fd0r0JkcHNMC5GJFMi8A/anf0T7hlRtndvaez6/d4eQhbAD3+w on the island of <LOCATION> not long after its annexation by <LOCATION>, Napoleon's modest family descended from minor <NRP> nobility. He supported the French Revolution in <DATE_TIME> while serving in the <NRP> army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing <LOCATION> by firing on royalist insurgents. In <DATE_TIME>, he began his first military campaign against the <NRP> and their <NRP> allies, scoring a series of decisive victories and becoming a national hero. <DATE_TIME>, he led a military expedition to <LOCATION> that served as a springboard to political power.

He engineered a coup in <DATE_TIME> and became First Consul of the Republic. Intractable differences with the <NRP> meant that the <NRP> were facing the War of the Third Coalition by <DATE_TIME>. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign, and a historic triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolving of the Holy Roman Empire. In <DATE_TIME>, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because <LOCATION> became worried about growing <NRP> influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly knocked out <LOCATION> at the battles of <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>, then marched the Grand Army deep into <LOCATION>, annihilating the <NRP> in <DATE_TIME> at +gWJSJJC+X7xgMt6ggxkT1HM0IKDkUFvcJZmwCv6QS8=, and forcing the defeated nations of <LOCATION> to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. <DATE_TIME>, the <NRP> challenged the <NRP> again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over <LOCATION> after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.

The <NRP> and the <NRP> revolted with <NRP> support. The Peninsular War lasted <DATE_TIME>, featured brutal guerrilla warfare, and culminated in a defeat for Napoleon's marshals.

In <DATE_TIME>, <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> joined <NRP> forces in a Sixth Coalition against <LOCATION>. A chaotic military campaign culminated in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in <DATE_TIME>. The coalition invaded <LOCATION> and captured <LOCATION>, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in <DATE_TIME>. Napoleon was exiled to the island of <LOCATION>, between Corsica and <LOCATION>. In <LOCATION>, the Bourbons were restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped from <LOCATION> in <DATE_TIME> and took control of <LOCATION>, "without spilling a drop of blood" as he wished.[5][6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in <DATE_TIME>. The <NRP> exiled him to the remote island of <LOCATION> in <LOCATION>, where he died in <DATE_TIME> at the age of <DATE_TIME>.

Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, especially the Low Countries, <LOCATION>, and large parts of modern <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in <LOCATION> and throughout Western Europe.[b] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been highly influential. Historian lqDH0Z1lgY3hhxaGMY85nYLuy68iSLC/Sn3souPgEQM= says, "The ideas that underpin our modern world—meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on—were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of <LOCATION>."[13]
